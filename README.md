Assignment 3 Question 1 -- Link: https://editor.p5js.org/clinardos/full/wCya8Rmzj For this question within the assignment I used a 400 x 400 canvas and the p5.js software to be able to complete it accurately. The first part of this assignment was all about creating our "catcher" this will act as the per se player in the game we will create by the end of this assignment. The "catcher" was required to fit into a 50x50 pixel square. After we had finalized our "catcher" we were then tasked to create a ground for the catcher to sit on. We also must create the code to allow the "catcher" to move with the mouse along the ground. I chose to create a coffee cup, which I created a function for called "addCoffeeCup". I created this using the multiple of the quad shapes. After creating the shape of the coffee cup, I was able to use the "drawingContext" command to create a shadow effect around my cup. I chose complimentary colors for the shadow and the cup. I then copied some code I had already previously made in a lab section for a smiley face and placed it on the center of the cup. I decided after placing the smiley face, that it should turn into a frowny face instead. Also, the smiley face changes as the cup moves across the sketch. I did this previously using "if-else" statements and simply altered the colors to match the already set aesthetic.
